I. Be a flask end point accessible to the entire internet hosted on an AWS machine.

Steps 

1. Created github repository 
    https://github.com/slpmssg12/grp8

included repository file for resources needed:
https://github.com/slpmssg12/grp8/blob/master/RESOURCES

provided documentation for deployment in a README
https://github.com/slpmssg12/grp8/blob/master/README.md

wrote import flask / website html python script:
https://github.com/slpmssg12/grp8/blob/master/flask_import.py


2. Created AWS instance

i-049e47ca4b94b31c8:8080/grp8

added inbound security rule to allow all traffic

II. Accept cURL calls on one (or more) routes and successfully return something (ideally   a 200 or 4XX status but never a 500) when called

Steps 

1. Created PyCharm virtual environment

2. Wrote get curls call to talk up to AWS server

III. Accept in a request with a payload including a string and a requested NLP service. Your project should be capable of returning 2 services for each member of your group.


1. Paste GET and POST requests into Pycharm and hit enter (below)

2. Click the now active url link to view the strings on the web

GET
import requests
url = "http://3.145.3.199:8080/grp8"
payload={}
headers = {}
response = requests.request("GET", url, headers=headers, data=payload)
print(response.text)


POST
#NLP Service 1: to lower case:
url = "http://3.145.3.199:8080/1"
string=("LOWERCASE: I don't remember the last three numbers; but, the first 2 were 40 five!")
response = requests.post(url, data=string)
print(response.text)

POST
#NLPService 2: remove numbers:
url = "http://3.145.3.199:8080/2"
string=("REMOVE NBRS: I don't remember the last three numbers; but, the first 2 were 40 five!")
response = requests.post(url, data=string)
print(response.text)

#NLP Service 3: extract the stream of tokens with the help of regular expressions
url = "http://3.145.3.199:8080/3"
string=("EXTRACT TOKENS: I don't remember the last three numbers; but, the first 2 were 40 five!")
response = requests.post(url, data=string)
print(response.text)
